## 1. Introduction

The game was designed to immerse players in a mysterious and challenging environment, demanding them to overcome obstacles, solve puzzles, and combat cursed enemies in a journey to break an ancient curse.


## 2. Overview of the Game

The game opens with a Main Menu, featuring two buttons: Start and Menu. Selecting Start launches a Prologue Sequence that sets the tone of the adventure, providing a brief background story:

    "For centuries the mountain stood silent, its peak shrouded in mysteries and shadows."
    "Now there are whispers of an ancient evil disturbing the peace."
    "The mountain awaits the hero that dares to break this curse..."

Following this, the player is shown a still frame of the adventurer before the mountain, marking the beginning of the actual gameplay.

## 3. Narrative and Gameplay Progression
### 3.1 The Cave Entrance

The adventurer begins at the entrance of a dark cave and must explore its depths. The cave is partially illuminated, with some darker, more dangerous areas deeper inside.

### 3.2 Enemies

Throughout the cave, the adventurer encounters various enemies:

    **Bats:** Aggressive, fast and omnipresent.

    **Green Organisms:** Passive creatures that wander randomly, but pack a punch when touched.

    **Cursed Soldiers:** Once part of an ancient expedition, now insane and hostile due to the curse.

These soldiers hint at a deeper story - a failed military occupation led by a general who brought an army into the mountain, now lost and corrupted.

### 3.3 Key Items and Puzzles

The player discovers several items and faces puzzle elements:

    **Lantern:** Helps illuminate dark areas.

    **Locked Doors:** Block progress until the correct keys are found.

    **Old Talking Tree:** Acts as a quest-giver. Upon receiving a desired item, it rewards the adventurer with a key.

    **Mega Blob Mid Boss:** A sentient, electric-powered version of the green organisms. After defeating it, the adventurer receives a second key.

    **Old Map:** Displays the locations of doors and their corresponding keys.

    **Hidden Switch:** Found behind a breakable wall. Activating it emits an electromagnetic pulse that shatters nearby crystals, one of which hides stairs to another key.

    **Shopkeeper Encounter:** A peaceful but unusual figure deep in the cave sells the final key to the player.

## 4. Final Encounter

Using the collected keys, the adventurer opens the final, largest door, which leads to the throne room of the mountain's king. The throne is now occupied by an evil genie.

The genie is immune to direct attacks and launches fireballs at the player. However, the adventurer notices a magical lamp in the corner of the room. Upon destroying the lamp, the genie is defeated, lifting the mountainâ€™s curse.

## 5. Ending

With the curse broken and the genie defeated, the adventurer is recognized as the hero foretold in legend, and the game concludes with a triumphant ending.
